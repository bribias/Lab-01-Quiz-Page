                    The breakbeat hardcore scene of the early 1990s was beginning to fragment by 1992/1993, with
                    different influence becoming less common together in tracks. The piano and uplifting vocal style
                    that was prevalent in breakbeat hardcore started to lay down the foundations of 4-beat/happy
                    hardcore, whilst tracks with dark-themed samples and industrial style stabs had emerged from late
                    1992 and named darkcore. Reggae samples and reggae influenced
                    tracks had been a feature of many breakbeat hardcore tracks since 1990 particularly from producers
                    such as Shut Up and Dance, however Ibiza Records, and the Rebel MC were arguably the first to bring
                    the sound system influence solidly into releases.

                    The track "We Are I.E." by Lennie De-Ice is often credited as being the track that laid down the
                    foundations for jungle with its ragga bassline. According to Simon Reynolds, jungle was like:
                    "Britain's very own equivalent to US hip-hop. That said, you could equally make the case that jungle
                    is a raved-up, digitised offshoot of Jamaican reggae. Musically, Jungle's spatialised production,
                    bass quake pressure and battery of extreme sonic effects, make it a sort of postmodern dub on
                    steroids.

                The term "jungle" is often used as a synonym for drum and bass, particularly in the United States. More commonly jungle is viewed as the originating point for drum and bass, with the progressive changes brought by artists in the late 1990s serving as the point of diversion.
